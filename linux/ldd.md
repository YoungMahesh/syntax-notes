`ldd` command in Linux is used to list the shared libraries (dynamic dependencies) required by an executable or shared object file.
It helps in troubleshooting issues related to missing or incompatible libraries by displaying the full paths to the libraries or indicating if any are missing.

```bash
ldd /snap/bin/chromium 
```
