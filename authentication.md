## ClerkJS
- support only metamask, not other web3 wallets
- cannot move user from development to production (need to think about this in future)

## ThirdwebJS
- complex documentation compared to clerk
- bundle too many products in subscriptions 
- create a non-custodial wallet, when user sign-in with email
  - private key of which is no accesssible to intrifund, nor to web3 illiterate people
  - in ui connected user can see the private-key, then most probably thirdweb developers have access to the private key
  - no built-in ui like clerk, to connect web3-wallets, phone-number to email

## AuthJS
- takes time for implementation
